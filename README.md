## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/psx-ai-advisor.git
cd psx-ai-advisor
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure the application:
   - Review and modify `config.yaml` as needed
   - Ensure data directories exist

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from psx_ai_advisor.data_acquisition import PSXDataAcquisition

# Download daily PDF
psx_data = PSXDataAcquisition()
pdf_path = psx_data.download_daily_pdf()
print(f"Downloaded: {pdf_path}")
```

### Configuration

The application uses `config.yaml` for configuration. Key sections include:

- `data_sources`: PSX URL and endpoints
- `technical_indicators`: SMA periods, RSI settings, MACD parameters
- `machine_learning`: Model configuration
- `storage`: Data directories and retention
- `performance`: Request timeouts and retry settings
